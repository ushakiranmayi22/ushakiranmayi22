👋 Hi, I’m @ushakiranmayi22

👀 I’m passionate about wireless systems, antenna engineering, and next-gen communication technologies.

🌱 I’m currently diving deep into compact MIMO designs, SDR (Software Defined Radio), and machine learning for RF applications.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative hardware projects, technical research papers, and open-source RF toolkits.

📫 Reach me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/usha-kiranmayee2004/ 

😄 Pronouns: She/Her

⚡ Fun fact: I love optimizing antenna performance almost as much as I love optimizing my coffee brew settings. ☕📡
